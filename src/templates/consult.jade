    h1 IT Consulting
    h2 Completed, correctly.
    h4 My eponymous company practices process driven IT consulting for organizations. Experience and quality begets efficiency and I deliver all three to my clients. I build elegant, robust, and rigorously tested virtualization and directory solutions using a process that I have iterated and honed for over 15 years.


  h1 Phased Project Approach
  p Through my years as a consultant I have honed a project approach that is carried out in distinct, linear phases.  These phases call out specific milestones that are marked by deliverables.  Deliverables can take the form of documents, functional systems, or accomplishments.  At the conclusion of each project phase, success will be measured and evaluated by each party.  Sometimes, the conclusion of a phase is the appropriate time to adjust the project deliverables, or even its goals and scope.

  h2 Phase 1: Discover
  p The first phase of solution delivery, this initiation phase is critical in establishing baseline expectations, environmental details, operational challenges and determining project success criteria.  This phase includes network and environmental discovery, wherein many of the assumptions made during the proposal process may be validated, representing an opportunity to mitigate concerns early before the project progresses any further.
  h2 Phase 2: Design and Plan
  p Following the discovery phase, the design and planning phase serves to map out the remainder of the project and further develop the high-level design presented during the proposal process.  The core project documentation is drafted, including Project Plan, Design, Implementation Plan, and Test Documents. Collaborative design sessions allow our team to work closely with your IT operations and management staff, facilitating a reciprocal exchange as all design aspects are thoroughly discussed and determined.
  h2 Phase 3: Test
  p Build the lab environment and test it against Test and Implementation Procedures. Build the pilot environment and test it against Implementation Procedures, User Experience, and Success Criteria. Revise Project Plan and Documentation against lessons learned.
  h2 Phase 4: Implement
  p Measure three times, cut once. You might notice that it seems like most of the work is done before the Implementation Phase. That is true. I believe you will be more efficient in the long run by being deliberate and careful in planning and testing before you take action.
  h2 Phase 5: Wrap Up
  p The environment is supported as needed. Documentation is revised as necessary. Final Knowledge Transfer is performed. Project debrief is held with lessons learned and outstanding issues recorded.

  h1 Subject Matter Expertise
  p These are the key technologies I have used to help my clients.
